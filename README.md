# Running Tracker App

The Running Tracker app is a mobile application that allows users to track their running activity in real-time. It was developed from scratch using best practices such as MVVM architecture, Navigation Components, Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection, Coroutines for asynchronous programming, Google Maps SDK for location tracking, and Live Data for real-time updates.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for easy navigation
- Ability to start, pause, and stop a running activity
- Real-time tracking of distance, speed, and time
- Map view with current location and running route
- Ability to save and view running history
- Dark mode support

## Getting Started

To get started with the Running Tracker app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the project to ensure that it is set up correctly.

## How it Works

The app works by using the Google Maps SDK to track the user's location and display their running route on a map in real-time. The MVVM architecture is used to separate the user interface (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and data (Model). Navigation Components are used to handle the navigation between different screens in the app. Dagger-Hilt is used for dependency injection, Coroutines are used for asynchronous programming, and Live Data is used for real-time updates. Users can start, pause, and stop a running activity, and the app tracks the distance, speed, and time of the activity. Running history is saved and can be viewed in the app.

## Technologies Used

The Running Tracker app was built using the following technologies:

- Android Studio
- Java/Kotlin
- MVVM architecture
- Navigation Components
- Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming
- Google Maps SDK for location tracking
- Live Data for real-time updates
- Room Persistence Library for local data storage

## Conclusion

The Running Tracker app provides a simple and convenient way for users to track their running activity and view their progress over time. With its user-friendly interface, real-time tracking, and history view, the app encourages users to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle. By following best practices such as MVVM, Navigation Components, Dagger-Hilt, Coroutines, Google Maps SDK, and Live Data, the app is built to be scalable, maintainable, and testable.
